    "description": "We are looking for an enthusiastic intern (Candidates pursuing M.Sc. in Computer Science preferred) with experience in Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning, and Neural Networks to join our Whole in One Framework Open Source Project. The primary focus of this role will be to create benchmarks that compare the performance of our new framework against classical machine learning models. The Whole in One Framework already provides a comprehensive model for implementing a new ML approach. Your contributions will help us evaluate and demonstrate how this innovative framework performs relative to traditional methods in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. Selected Intern's Day-to-Day Responsibilities Include: 1. Benchmark development: a. Design and develop tests and evaluations to compare the new framework with classical machine learning models. b. Set up experiments to assess key performance indicators such as training speed, model accuracy, and resource usage. 2. Model implementation and integration: a. Implement the new ML model according to our provided framework guidelines. b. Adapt the model to incorporate a dual-weight structure, where each connection from the input uses a combination of two sets of parameters. c. Develop a process for mapping input data to activation values, and enforce a constraint that limits how much the activation can change between training iterations. d. Create a custom training loop that uses an entropy-gradient-based update method to adjust the model parameters, rather than relying on conventional loss-based optimizers. 3. Live data and model evaluation: a. Develop experiments to test the performance of the new framework using both static and live datasets. b. Compare the results with those from classical models using standardized benchmarks. c. Visualize the outcomes through clear plots and tables. 4 Collaboration and reporting: a. Work closely with our team to integrate your benchmarks into our open-source project. b. Document your methodology, experimental setup, and findings in a detailed report. c. Provide clear, well-commented code and instructions so that other team members can easily reproduce your results.",
